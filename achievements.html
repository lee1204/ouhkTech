                            <p>A team of three final year computing students participated in the annual IEEE FYP Competition and brought home a first runner-up award with their research paper "Intelligent Traffic Light System for Hong Kong Traffic Network".<br>

                                Their award-winning paper attempts to offer a solution to reduce traffic congestion in Hong Kong by designing an intelligent traffic light system to optimize traffic flow. With the data of road usage collected, the trio conducted a thorough analysis and successfully designed and developed an algorithm for an intelligent traffic light control system which can detect traffic flow in real time and switch traffic light signals to reduce average waiting time of pedestrians and vehicles. It is believed that their intelligent traffic light control system could increase the efficiency of the road space usage and improve the traffic condition in Hong Kong.</p>
