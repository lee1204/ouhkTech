                                        <p>Hugo Leung Wai-yin, who graduated from his four-year programme in 2015, won the Best Paper Award for his ‘intelligent pill-dispenser’ design at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering’s International Conference on Consumer Electronics – China 2015.</p>
                                        <p>The pill-dispenser alerts patients via sound and LED flashes to pre-set dosage and time intervals. Unlike units currently on the market, Hugo’s design connects to any mobile phone globally. In explaining how it works, he said: ‘There are three layers in the portable pillbox. The lowest level is a controller with various devices which can be connected to mobile phones in remote locations. Patients are alerted by a sound alarm and flashes. Should they fail to follow their prescribed regime, data can be sent via SMS to relatives and friends for follow up.’ The pill-dispenser has four medicine slots, plus a back-up with a LED alert, topped by a 500ml water bottle. It took Hugo three months of research and coding to complete his design, but he feels it was worth all his time and effort.</p>
                                        <p>Hugo’s public examination results were disappointing and he was at a loss about his future before enrolling at the OUHK, which he now realizes was a major turning point in his life. He is grateful for the OUHK’s learning environment, its industry links and the positive guidance and encouragement from his teachers. The University is now exploring the commercial potential of his design with a pharmaceutical company. He hopes that this will benefit the elderly and chronically ill, as well as the society at large.</p>
                                        <p>Soon after completing his studies, Hugo joined an automation technology company as an assistant engineer.
                                        He is responsible for the design and development of automation devices. The target is to minimize human labor and increase the quality of products. He is developing products which are used in various sections, including healthcare, manufacturing and consumer electronics.</p>

                                        <p>I am Chu Cheuk Ling Tiffany. My interest in computer science started from the ICT course in my secondary school and carried forward during my study in OUHK for the Bachelor of Computing with Honours in Internet Technology. I would say OUHK is an efficient and effective channel to push up my study in computing and a good stepping stone for my future career. The study in OUHK has enriched my knowledge broadly.</p>
                                        <p>The programme covers a lot of information. In year 1 and 2, I learned basic programming skills, such as C and Java programming, data structure, and information and communication technology concepts. Those knowledge provided me a foundation to the road of programming. In year 3 and 4, I could got understanding with practical knowledge on more specialized areas, such as software engineering, database technologies, web and mobile programming, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The concepts enabled me to design and develop application that can be meaningful to society and people. It also contributes tremendously to my FYP and support for my future development as an IT expert.</p>
                                        <p>FYP is the most challenging subject for me for the whole programme. The project requires us to analyze real-world problems, formulate possible solutions to address them, and look for future development. The project involves integration of technologies learnt from the courses. My project is to design and develop an AI mobile application to boosts a pre-meeting preparation for product innovation meeting of household goods. The proposed solution starts from the use of mobile idea generation to automated idea consolidation through an AI mobile application called EE Meeting Booster. The application will finally perform an automated analyze to draft out a clear summary from the consolidated data.

                                        <h6>IT Security Analyst</h6>
                                        <p>Yujia is a 2018 graduate of the Bachelor of Computing with Honours in Internet Technology programme. During the week he works as an internet security analyst as part of Hong Kong Telecom’s threat management team and takes great pleasure in rising to the challenges involved. ‘Internet technology advances in leaps and bounds,’ Yujia remarks. ‘We must keep learning new technical skills and acquiring the relevant qualifications. This gives me a great sense of satisfaction.’ It is indeed hard to imagine this proactive, confident gentleman as anything close to being ‘timid’ — a description of his old self.</p>
                                        <p>Yujia did not perform particularly well in the first two years of university. While feeling stuck, Yujia learned from his professors that IBM was recruiting a full-time intern for a one-year term. He decided to give it a try. What he had learned in class served him well in the interviews, yet it was in the actual workplace that he began to truly come to grips with the industry. ‘We were still doing the foundation courses in the first two years at school and I didn’t quite have a clear picture of the applications of Internet technology at that time,’ says Yujia. ‘But at IBM, I came across the emerging technology of cloud computing for the first time. The chance to delve into their latest cloud platform, Bluemix, was definitely an eye-opener for me.’</p>
                                        <p>Yujia was quite another person when he returned to school the following year. ‘As the Chinese saying goes,’ he relates, ‘“learning alone without peers leaves one ignorant and ill-informed,” so I decided to sign up for an orientation event. There, I met five Year 3 entrants who later became my closest study buddies.’ Peer motivation worked wonders. Not only did Yujia eventually get onto the Dean’s list twice, he also stood out in external competitions. With the final-year project ‘Safety Awareness and Firefighting Skills Learning through Virtual Reality (VR)’, his team won accolades at the Asia Pacific Information and Communications Technology Alliance Awards and the Pan-Pearl River Delta Region IT Project Competition in 2018.</p>

                                        <p>Having left school after Secondary Five, Tse Kong-hoi regretted not having taken his studies seriously when he entered the career market. To make up for this, he completed a part-time higher diploma programme while working as an apprentice at Towngas. In 2007, he took a step towards his dream of getting a university degree — by enrolling on the OUHK’s degree programme in computer engineering, which he completed in just three years. During his studies, he was employed twice, first with the MTR Corporation and then with Ocean Park, doing machine repair work. Then, upon graduation, he gained a job offer from his old employer, Towngas.</p>
                                        <p>In his new position as Training Officer, Kong-hoi is responsible for training apprentices and technicians, and needs to deal with Government officials and engineers from time to time. For further development, he decided to study for a master’s degree in engineering management, with the full support of his supervisor. Kong-hoi graduated in 2016.</p>
                                        <p>The apprentice-turned-apprentice-trainer is extremely grateful to the OUHK for this second chance to acquire higher qualifications which have opened up many opportunities along his career path.</p>

                                        <p>Dr Cheung Kam-wai is the General Manager of the Telecom Division of Fujitsu Hong Kong Limited. He obtained a Master of Science in Energy and Environmental Sustainability at OUHK in 2011. The following year he further enrolled in our Doctor of Engineering programme to pursue studies in energy management and graduate 2015.</p>
                                        <p>One reason why he is partial to our distance learning programmes is that they are an excellent platform for developing contacts with people from different walks of life. ‘Many of my classmates are managerial staff in major corporations. Others come from NGOs with a mission in environmental protection. We have had frequent and free-wheeling exchange of views, from which we all benefit,’ he explained. He was equally impressed with the professionalism of the instructors, not to mention the comprehensive and practical nature of the programmes. They are exactly what he needs for his work.</p>
                                        <p>Dr Cheung has major enterprises, telecom companies and financial institutions as his clientele. His clients are increasingly concerned with environmental protection. Conversant with environmental protection, he enjoys an edge in communicating with his clients. At the same time, in making bids in the tendering process, having the relevant know-how is a definite advantage. The courses he took touch on various aspects of the discipline and opened his mind in his work. In 2013, his academic achievements won him the Outstanding Student Award.</p>

                                        The program gives solid knowledge of different statistical models, data handling and programming skills(SAS). It really helps me for my career as a data analyst. Lecturers in the program are willing to help. I also appreciate to have a chance to publish conference papers with one of the lecturer. It is a precious experience which can strengthen my practical skill of ETL and statistical modelling on real-world data.</p>

                                        <p>This program provides a chance for non-statistics AD/HD graduates to 'transfrom' into applied statsitcs discipline. "Three HKSS gradaute diploma exams are exempted after completing his program and i only need to pass the 2 remaining exams to obtain the gradaute diploma certification. Hodler's of the HKSS gradaute diploma certification can apply for the society's professional status of graduate statistician." On the other hand, the OUHK courses equipped me with essential statistical knowledge. I was exempted from studying the 'Research methods for interdisciplinary studies' and 'Probability and Statistics' courses in my Master of Art program and this helps to reduce the studying time and tuition fee.</p>
