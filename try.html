                                            <p>The Peer Tutoring Scheme has been established in the Computing Programmes Team since 2008/09. The computing programme offers 6 to 8 positions of Peer Tutors every year to final year students in BCOMPHITJ.  Peer Tutors are honourable appointments and receive an hourly part-time job rate as Student Trainee.</p>
                                            <p>Peer tutors are student leaders who are responsible for assisting the instruction work in the computing programme team.  In most cases, they will be involved in classroom teaching and consultation under the supervision of an instructor.  Sometimes they will be assigned to other duties such as clerical work and event helpers.   They are regarded as part of the teaching team of OUHK Computing.   The appointees will gain valuable experience at tertiary level instruction.</p>
                                            <p>The past peer tutors developed strong leadership through the programme which is helpful to their career.

                                            <p>Open InnoChallenge (OIC) is a brand-new endeavor launched in 2017 organized by Student Affairs Office (SAO) aiming to unleash students’ creativity and innovation, and enhance students’ entrepreneurial skills to translate the innovative ideas “into viable operation” for profit or for social good. It strives to inspire students’ innovation via “Experience” and “Empower” in the way of out-of-the-classroom learning. It encourages students to develop a feasible proposal for a startup enterprise with funding of $100,000.</p>
                                            <p>This year, two teams of computing graduates have successfully obtained a start-up fund of HK$100,000 for their awarded projects, Banana Portal and Fruit Peel Family, in order to carry out their business plan. The Open InnoCelebration was also held on 21 September 2019, an Awards Presentation Ceremony cum Exhibition of Open InnoChallenge which OU students and alumni demonstrate their innovative projects. Apart from creative exhibition booths, OU students will also host a series of interactive workshops to promote environmental protection and emotional health.</p>
